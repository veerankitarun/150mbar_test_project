Welcome to the Differential Pressure Transmitter with I²C Output project repository! This project involves reading pressure and temperature data from a sensor using the I²C communication protocol.

## Overview

This project focuses on interfacing with a differential pressure sensor that communicates over the I²C protocol. The sensor provides pressure and temperature readings, which are then processed and displayed through an Arduino microcontroller. The provided code enables you to read and interpret data from the sensor.

## Features

- Read differential pressure and temperature data from the sensor.
- Utilize I²C communication protocol for sensor interaction.
- Calculate and display pressure in hectopascals (hPa) and temperature in Celsius (°C).

## Applications

This project finds applications in various scenarios, including:

- **Flow Control and Filter Monitoring:** The project can be used for differential pressure measurement, making it suitable for flow control and filter monitoring in building measurement systems. This is particularly valuable in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems, where maintaining proper airflow and filter efficiency is crucial for indoor air quality.

- **Pressure Level Control and Gas Dosing:** Additionally, the project is applicable to gauge pressure measurement. It can be employed for pressure level control and gas dosing tasks, such as in respirators or medical equipment. The accurate measurement of pressure is vital for delivering precise amounts of gas and maintaining safe pressure levels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Basic understanding of Arduino programming and I²C communication

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
4. Open the `script4.ino` file from the repository in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

### Usage

1. Make sure the pressure sensor is connected to the Arduino properly.
2. Power up your Arduino.
3. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the pressure and temperature readings.
4. The readings will be displayed in hectopascals (hPa) for pressure and Celsius (°C) for temperature.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with I²C communication, double-check your wiring and connections.
- Ensure that the sensor is properly powered and connected to the correct pins on the Arduino.
